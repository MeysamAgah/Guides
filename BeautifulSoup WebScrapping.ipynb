Tout d'abord, on peut citer la bande-son qui est subliminal, on peut notamment faire référence à l'OST du combat de radahn, radagon ou encore Godfrey. De même,Hidetaka Miyazaki expose ici aux joueurs un lore énorme composé d'un nombre incalculable de détails, comme le passé de l'univers avec les Dragons-Anciens et Placidusax le seigneur des dragons. On apprend une immensité de chose à travers le lore comme l'assassinat de Godwyn commit par Ranni, l'histoire de Vyke, les malédiction des 3 enfants issus de Marika et Radagon. Bref, tout ce que j'ai cité ne définit même pas 1% du lore. Aussi, le gameplay est très bien gérer pour le joueur, la manière dont le jeu force l'apprentissage des paternes en créer une satisfaction, de même on peut compter un nombre incalculable d'armes, de sorts et pleins d'autres mécaniques. La manière dont les combats sont fait génère un dynamisme de gameplay. Les quêtes sont multiples et intéressantes mais assez mal guidés, mais cela fait partie de l'essence même des souls. Les graphismes sont pas révolutionnaire mais celle-ci est en cohésion avec le design du jeu qui en fait de lui un jeu magnifique. En autre, Elden Ring possède un nombre incalculable de points positifs qui prendrait un temps fou à citer. Une expérience à vivre.\",\n",

The combat feels as good as ever, with quick responses to your inputs and nice flow and feeling of weight overall. With a variety of classes to choose from, and playstyles that suit every player this game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. From summons to spirit NPC ashes, you can choose whether to fight solo or with an ally. There is one bossfight where I definitely recommend using summons and that's the Godskin Duo. Now on the story side of ****'S MINDBLOWNLINGLY EPIC! Overall it makes you feel like you're rising up to the top becoming stronger and stronger, culminating in an epic final **** the negatives now...Some classes and builds are way better than others, making fights hilariously easy but again that's up to the player. I didn't involve myself in the PVP so no comments on that. A lot of assets are re-used but I kind of expected that in a game as massive as this. Lastly, a lot of the bosses in the late game are really hard, not allowing the player with a window of opportunity for a counter attack and with endgame damage stats, the fights become really hard and are a matter of patience. But overall I don't have anything major to say in regard to the bad aspects of the ****: The music in certain bossfights just gives me chills(Mohg, Lord of Blood cough cough)\",\n",

The World is just enormous compared to previous titles in terms of space and easily on par in terms of zones.  The combat is very similar with new special moves added to allow for greater variety and speed.\\\\n\\\\nThe zones are generally fun to explore (albeit the size makes the main open world zones tedious).  The legacy dungeons are fun and interesting with branching and puzzles.\\\\n\\\\nBosses are largely just not fun to fight.  They are far too aggressive unless you use multiplayer\\\\u002Fsummons which tend to make them easier than you would like.  This leads to you either spending time waiting out combos to look for a tiny opening window where you don’t have time to use most interesting skills or to hit them while their attention is on someone else.  The latter doesn’t give much satisfaction to many players.\\\\n\\\\nMini dungeons have the same problem as chalice dungeons from blood borne.  They all feel samey and boring with a few exceptions.\\\\n\\\\nNPC quest lines are enjoyable, but difficult to find and follow in the open world.\\\\n\\\\nOverall there’s a lot to enjoy, but I personally feel like the game drags really badly the later you get with boss fights getting more frequent.  Each successive one just wears rather than brings joy. I’ve not gotten this feeling from any other fromsoft title, nor many of the more popular Derivative titles.\\\\n\\\\nIn the end you’ll get your money’s worth of fun and playtime, but may end up with a bitter feeling about it.',\n",

(Which by the way sekiro is objectively THE best fromsoft game. It has a focused and rewarding system (the parry system) along with a new element, the grapple. If I took every fromsoft game and stripped the color from them and put them side by side you would not be able to tell the difference. Except sekiro. now the next problem is the game doesn’t actually improve at all? It seems they spent three years just making the map? Lmao. I was expecting something as unique and as fun as sekiro OR something as refined as lies of p. LoP is also the second best fromsoft game, that’s not made by fromsoft. The only really negative reviews on the game are just saying it’s more of a “refinement not an improvement” or that “they copied fromsoft” and fromsoft copied ninja gaiden. What’s your point? that’s exactly what it is, and it does it extremely well. Lies of p takes Essentially the best thing from every from soft game and puts it in one game. Along with a more understandable story and its own unique theme and gameplay\\\\u002F combat systems. I was expecting far more out of Elden ring yet it falls short unfortunately. I tried playing the game so many times and I really just tried to like it, but it’s simply a literal copy and paste of DS3. That goes for pretty much most fromsoft games. If you have played one fromsoft game, you basically played them all. And unfortunately they are the most toxic players in video games if you try to tell them that they’re buying the same game every year like COD, they will gang up and you and start **** on each other lol. Proof of this is the success of lies of p.  round8 studio made a game far better than pretty much anything put out by fromsoft and the only people hating were fromsoft ****. We all know if from soft put out lies of P they would be praising and **** it off lol. They buy the same game every year. Then turn around and make fun of Ubisoft and Activision….. The irony lol. In Elden ring especially Malenia. she has a certain move set called the waterfall dance or something like that. She and a few others are a perfect example of poorly made game decisions and boss moveset. That certain movement is CLEARLY A copy out of sekiro and meant to be parryied, yet it’s not parryable. They essentially copied boss moves from sekiro, giving bosses, sekiro boss like movement and patterns. while giving the actual player dark souls 1 movement  you see similar problems in one of the most recent call of duty games, And why copying things from other games doesn’t always work. In the newest Mw3 2023 they took over a decade old maps that is designed with positioning and slow movement in mind from the OG mw2 and ported it in a game where you get across the map in literally 4 seconds….. essentially destroying any actually positioning or strongholds on the map. That would be the main fight  locations for players. And this goes for every map. Was really excited, expecting something NEW from fromsoftware like sekiro. Unfortunately this is what we got. Not to mention game looks like a early ps4 game or late ps3 game. The game also plays in 60fps on ps5, but for some reason the game looks like it moves in a choppy 40. Like it’s having microstutters or something. It’s probably their engine as it feels they have been using the same ps3 engine the whole time or something.

              " 'Jogo maravilhoso, com uma exploração incrível que só por si é uma experiência única, a sensação incrível que é procurar as coisas pelo mapa, com essa ambientação incrível, o combate que é também uma delícia, e super bem feito, com bosses muito criativos e difíceis na medida certa\\\\n(Menção honrosa para Malenia, uma das melhores batalhas que já tive em um videogame)\\\\nE também os detalhes do jogo, tudo bem feitinho, um dos MELHORES jogos já feitos na HISTÓRIA',\n",
              " 'Early game review, will probably change it later\\\\nI’ve never been a fan of soulslike games, even after playing ds1 and demon’s souls, and I’m having open world fatigue thanks to Genshin Impact. With that being said, this game is amazing. The overworld exploration feels clean, smooth and definitely not empty. The combat system looks complex at first glance, but after some practice you start to understand all the mechanics needed, and even though I died a lot of times by now I still think the game itself is not as hard as other games, and getting used to it is pretty easy. Definitely recommend.',\n",
              " 'Le jeux est vraiment mal fait il est (dur) parce que il est mal fait il serait plus rapide et plus fluide il y aurais aucune difficulté rare sont les boss qui sont pas triplé il sont même pas très bien fait les zone sont horrible et pas amusant on joue tous au jeux parce ses FROMSOFTWARE sinon personne ne jouerais a se jeux complètement nul',\n",
              " 'It is, in my opinion, the best game available. I admit that I put off playing it for a considerable amount of time until my friend persuaded me to give it a try. Before I knew it, I had devoted more than 100 hours to the game. In my opinion, it is the best game ever created.']"
