There might be a story, but after 60 hours of play time I have pretty much no idea of what was happening other than me becoming the \"Elden Lord\" after slaying about 40 bosses with the same jump attack strategy. Also I don't think it's an indicator **** single player game when I have to read ten guides online and watch multiple youtube videos in order to understand the builds or basically how almost anything in this game even works on a basic level.

The inclusion of the same tedious combat mechanics and clunky interface from earlier games is disappointing, but if you've never played one of FROM's artificially difficult hack-and-slash action titles, then ER is probably the most inviting entry point. Ignore the incoherent \"story\" and lack of helpful information in-game, crack open a wiki, and prepare to die many deaths before you find a playstyle that works for you. There is fun to be found in Elden Ring, but digging it up can take some serious effort, a varied approach, and all too many hours of repetitive game loops.\n",
            "Quote 15: Un des mes jeux préférés. Je l'ai fait à plusieurs reprises. L'œuvre de Miyazaki nous plonge dans un jeux vidéos riches sur tout les plans. Tout d'abord, on peut citer la bande-son qui est subliminal, on peut notamment faire référence à l'OST du combat de radahn, radagon ou encore Godfrey. De même,Hidetaka Miyazaki expose ici aux joueurs un lore énorme composé d'un nombre incalculable de détails, comme le passé de l'univers avec les Dragons-Anciens et Placidusax le seigneur des dragons. On apprend une immensité de chose à travers le lore comme l'assassinat de Godwyn commit par Ranni, l'histoire de Vyke, les malédiction des 3 enfants issus de Marika et Radagon. Bref, tout ce que j'ai cité ne définit même pas 1% du lore. Aussi, le gameplay est très bien gérer pour le joueur, la manière dont le jeu force l'apprentissage des paternes en créer une satisfaction, de même on peut compter un nombre incalculable d'armes, de sorts et pleins d'autres mécaniques. La manière dont les combats sont fait génère un dynamisme de gameplay. Les quêtes sont multiples et intéressantes mais assez mal guidés, mais cela fait partie de l'essence même des souls. Les graphismes sont pas révolutionnaire mais celle-ci est en cohésion avec le design du jeu qui en fait de lui un jeu magnifique. En autre, Elden Ring possède un nombre incalculable de points positifs qui prendrait un temps fou à citer. Une expérience à vivre.\n",
            "Quote 16: TLDR: Yes the game is amazing, with epic fights, a larger scale to its story and with really tough endgame bosses!This game is everything fans loved about the series but brought to the open world. The combat feels as good as ever, with quick responses to your inputs and nice flow and feeling of weight overall. With a variety of classes to choose from, and playstyles that suit every player this game can be as easy or as hard as you want it to be. From summons to spirit NPC ashes, you can choose whether to fight solo or with an ally. There is one bossfight where I definitely recommend using summons and that's the Godskin Duo. Now on the story side of ****'S MINDBLOWNLINGLY EPIC! Overall it makes you feel like you're rising up to the top becoming stronger and stronger, culminating in an epic final **** the negatives now...Some classes and builds are way better than others, making fights hilariously easy but again that's up to the player. I didn't involve myself in the PVP so no comments on that. A lot of assets are re-used but I kind of expected that in a game as massive as this. Lastly, a lot of the bosses in the late game are really hard, not allowing the player with a window of opportunity for a counter attack and with endgame damage stats, the fights become really hard and are a matter of patience. But overall I don't have anything major to say in regard to the bad aspects of the ****: The music in certain bossfights just gives me chills(Mohg, Lord of Blood cough cough)\n",

Die Welt ist voller Geheimnisse, die es zu entdecken gilt, und die Lore ist so tiefgründig, dass sie immer wieder neue Interpretationen zulässt. Das Spielerlebnis ist herausfordernd, aber fair.

            "Quote 21: I really wanted to like this game, but just 5 hours in all I can say is that I regret buying it (although I got it on sale, it still stings). - Story feels non-existent - Atmosphere is depressing - No music while you play - Progression is super slow - Graphics look old - Loot drops are 99% garbage - Controls and inventory management are poor - Crafting is pointless - Armour and Weapon upgrades don’t matter - Combat is slow and clunky - Open world feels empty - Game feels hard on purpose to mask that it’s not a fun game - Boss fights are fun, but that’s about it All you do is go around killing things to save up “Runes” (XP) to cash in for levelling up, and you never actually feel any stronger. I have 5 hours into it, watched a few hours of videos to see if I was “missing something” or “not playing it properly”, and can quite confidently say this game isn’t for me, and I can’t understand why it won GOTY and gets such high review scores. I guess games journalists just don’t represent me any more, given the last few years.\n",

            "Quote 23: Elden ring has good world design, tons of content, great customization, but really poor boss fights and mini dungeons that weigh it down for a solo player. If you enjoyed previous fromsoft games you’ll likely enjoy most of what Elden ring has to offer, especially early on. The World is just enormous compared to previous titles in terms of space and easily on par in terms of zones. The combat is very similar with new special moves added to allow for greater variety and speed. The zones are generally fun to explore (albeit the size makes the main open world zones tedious). The legacy dungeons are fun and interesting with branching and puzzles. Bosses are largely just not fun to fight. They are far too aggressive unless you use multiplayer/summons which tend to make them easier than you would like. This leads to you either spending time waiting out combos to look for a tiny opening window where you don’t have time to use most interesting skills or to hit them while their attention is on someone else. The latter doesn’t give much satisfaction to many players. Mini dungeons have the same problem as chalice dungeons from blood borne. They all feel samey and boring with a few exceptions. NPC quest lines are enjoyable, but difficult to find and follow in the open world. Overall there’s a lot to enjoy, but I personally feel like the game drags really badly the later you get with boss fights getting more frequent. Each successive one just wears rather than brings joy. I’ve not gotten this feeling from any other fromsoft title, nor many of the more popular Derivative titles. In the end you’ll get your money’s worth of fun and playtime, but may end up with a bitter feeling about it.\n",

            "Quote 26: This game isn’t a master piece like everyone says. It has a few BIG problems. For example your character moves like in demon souls, yet the bosses move like it’s sekiro. (Which by the way sekiro is objectively THE best fromsoft game. It has a focused and rewarding system (the parry system) along with a new element, the grapple. If I took every fromsoft game and stripped the color from them and put them side by side you would not be able to tell the difference. Except sekiro. now the next problem is the game doesn’t actually improve at all? It seems they spent three years just making the map? Lmao. I was expecting something as unique and as fun as sekiro OR something as refined as lies of p. LoP is also the second best fromsoft game, that’s not made by fromsoft. The only really negative reviews on the game are just saying it’s more of a “refinement not an improvement” or that “they copied fromsoft” and fromsoft copied ninja gaiden. What’s your point? that’s exactly what it is, and it does it extremely well. Lies of p takes Essentially the best thing from every from soft game and puts it in one game. Along with a more understandable story and its own unique theme and gameplay/ combat systems. I was expecting far more out of Elden ring yet it falls short unfortunately. I tried playing the game so many times and I really just tried to like it, but it’s simply a literal copy and paste of DS3. That goes for pretty much most fromsoft games. If you have played one fromsoft game, you basically played them all. And unfortunately they are the most toxic players in video games if you try to tell them that they’re buying the same game every year like COD, they will gang up and you and start **** on each other lol. Proof of this is the success of lies of p. round8 studio made a game far better than pretty much anything put out by fromsoft and the only people hating were fromsoft ****. We all know if from soft put out lies of P they would be praising and **** it off lol. They buy the same game every year. Then turn around and make fun of Ubisoft and Activision….. The irony lol. In Elden ring especially Malenia. she has a certain move set called the waterfall dance or something like that. She and a few others are a perfect example of poorly made game decisions and boss moveset. That certain movement is CLEARLY A copy out of sekiro and meant to be parryied, yet it’s not parryable. They essentially copied boss moves from sekiro, giving bosses, sekiro boss like movement and patterns. while giving the actual player dark souls 1 movement you see similar problems in one of the most recent call of duty games, And why copying things from other games doesn’t always work. In the newest Mw3 2023 they took over a decade old maps that is designed with positioning and slow movement in mind from the OG mw2 and ported it in a game where you get across the map in literally 4 seconds….. essentially destroying any actually positioning or strongholds on the map. That would be the main fight locations for players. And this goes for every map. Was really excited, expecting something NEW from fromsoftware like sekiro. Unfortunately this is what we got. Not to mention game looks like a early ps4 game or late ps3 game. The game also plays in 60fps on ps5, but for some reason the game looks like it moves in a choppy 40. Like it’s having microstutters or something. It’s probably their engine as it feels they have been using the same ps3 engine the whole time or something. Overall it’s not a bad game, but realistically it’s a 7-8/10\n",

The exploring part is my favorite part of this game, if you choose to just explore that one random part of the cave, you might just find an interesting piece of lore about the world of Elden Ring, or if you choose to explore the dungeons that are the catacombs, you will find other interesting pieces about the world.

A integração entre narrativa e cenários, seja no aspecto visual ou temático, impacta diretamente a experiência de jogo, elevando-a a um nível excepcional. Cada batalha, escolha de estilo de jogo, e construção de personagens (como builds e abordagens estratégicas) foram projetadas para proporcionar uma experiência verdadeiramente única.O aspecto que mais me impressionou foi a incrível capacidade do jogo de combinar variedade e qualidade. Não conheço outro título que consiga executar essa integração de maneira tão magistral. A trilha sonora, direção artística, design de cenários, criaturas e personagens não jogáveis (NPCs) mantêm um padrão extraordinário de excelência. Elden Ring não apenas oferece diversidade em conteúdo, mas também assegura que cada elemento esteja à altura da qualidade esperada de uma obra-prima.

The player character (Tarnished) has no idle animation for when people walk away from the their controller although the game istelf is filled with a number of animations for the tarnished to be able to complete at the press of a button a lack of idle waiting animation to help characterize the tarnished or at least as a small flourish for the player is abysmal especially considering the fact that this game is filled with a number of small things that many would overlook in such a large game.

With that being said, this game is amazing. The overworld exploration feels clean, smooth and definitely not empty. The combat system looks complex at first glance, but after some practice you start to understand all the mechanics needed, and even though I died a lot of times by now I still think the game itself is not as hard as other games, and getting used to it is pretty easy.
